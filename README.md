# PdfToExcel
This is a PdfToExcel filetype converter application designed using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.
Feel free to use this repository in any capacity. I have licensed it under the MIT License.

Included are image assets as well as a .ico icon file which are relevant for use with Textron.
The original design was conceived while employed by Textron and intended for use by Textron employees
in Enterprise environments. If adapting this software to your own personal, private, or commercial 
needs please use your own image assets and change the title accordingly.

In this repo you will find my project solution and any questions regarding this repo
